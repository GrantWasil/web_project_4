### Overview

* Figma
* Javascript

**Figma**

All of the content was provided to me through a Figma project where I was able to export all images and convert them through a third party tool to optimize effiency. I was also able to better understand the sizing expectations through Figma.

**Javascript**

I'm using some basic Javascript to create a functioning edit page to allow the user to change their profile settings.
